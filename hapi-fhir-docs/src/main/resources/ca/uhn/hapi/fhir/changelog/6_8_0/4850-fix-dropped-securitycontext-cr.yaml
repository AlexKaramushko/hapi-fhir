type: fix
issue: 4850
title: "When running clinical-reasoning module in partitioned environment with threading options enabled, security context 
was dropping on async executor of measure processor, which blocked it from accessing required resources for measure evaluations (library, patients, etc). 
To fix this we updated MeasureProcessor to have an injectable executor property which is now being loaded from a bean 
in hapi-fhir's clinical-reasoning configuration, with needed security context delegation"
