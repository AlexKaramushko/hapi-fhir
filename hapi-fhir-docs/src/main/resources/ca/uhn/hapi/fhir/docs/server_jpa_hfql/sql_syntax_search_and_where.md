# HFQL SQL Syntax: Search and Where

HFQL provides two mechanisms for selecting specific data from the database: _SEARCH_ and _WHERE_. These two mechanisms have very different abilities and performance characteristics so it is important to understand when to use each one.

# Search Clauses

The HFQL _SEARCH_ keyword is used to apply standard FHIR search expressions to restrict the data being returned. This is generally much more performant than using _WHERE_ clauses so it should always be preferred.

The basic syntax for search clauses is: [param_name] = '[param_value'. Both _param_name_ and _param_value_ appear exactly as they would within a [FHIR search URL](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_standard/fhir_search_queries.html). 

A simple example follows:

```sql
SELECT name.family, name.given
FROM Patient
SEARCH identifier = 'http://system|value'
```

Modifiers and other advanced search parameters are also supported. The following example shows a `_has` parameter being used to return the IDs of patients having an Observation generated by a device with the given identifier.

```sql
SELECT
   id
FROM
   Patient
SEARCH
   _has:Observation:subject:device.identifier = 'http://foo|1234'
```

Values can include prefix comparators in HFQL expressions just as they can in search URLs. They can also be combined using the _AND_ keyword.

```sql
SELECT id
FROM Observation
SEARCH 
    code = 'http://loinc.org|29463-7'
    AND
    value-quantity = 'lt5|http://unitsofmeasure.org|kg'
```

# Where Clauses

SQL statements can also use the _WHERE_ keyword to restrict the data that is returned. While the _SEARCH_ keyword uses database search indexes to determine whether data should be included, the _WHERE_ keyword filters data after it has been loaded from the database.

A _WHERE_ clause uses a [FHIRPath Expression](https://smilecdr.com/docs/fhir_standard/fhirpath_expressions.html), and can filter based on any element in any resource. 

_WHERE_ clauses have the advantage that they are not limited to existing SearchParameter indexes. However, they have the disadvantage that they need to load every candidate resource in order to apply FHIRPath tests to it. This means that using _WHERE_ will often be **much slower** than using _SEARCH_ clauses. If at all possible, you should use _SEARCH_ clauses first and then add additional _SELECT_ clauses to further refine your criteria.
