type: fix
issue: 3540
title: "Previously, if you searched with only the `_source` search parameter, resources that had the right source value, but wrong resource type were being returned. e.g. 
`Patient?_source=foo` could potentially return non-Patient resources. This has been corrected. A data reindex is required to update all existing resources."
